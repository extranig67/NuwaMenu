# 🌙 ElysiumModMenu

**ElysiumModMenu** is an advanced **BepInEx IL2CPP mod menu for Among Us** with host tools, ESP, anti-cheat utilities, spoofing, local identity tweaks, chat QoL, and lobby automation.

Not just another menu. It is built for people who want more lobby control, cleaner info, better protection, and less nonsense from crashers or spammy modders.

> [!CAUTION]
> This menu includes powerful host-side and network-related tools. Use it responsibly. Private lobbies with friends are the best place for the wild stuff.
